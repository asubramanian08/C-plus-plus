## C-plus-plus

### Organization
Every topic or chapter in the book is made a new folder. In general each folder represents a new week. In the STL topic especially there can be sub-topics like iterators and sets. In each folder there is the teacher exercises (if necessary) and each question gets its own folder. The questions are named as such: TE = Teacher Exercise, PE = Programming Exercise with the number following it being the question number.

### About
I am learning c++ (classes, stl, ...) with Mr. Mabrey. I started around the beginning of 2021. It is the part 5 of the [storming robots](https://stormingrobots.com/prod/default.html) [algorithms track](https://www.stormingrobots.com/prod/pdf/csSyllabus.pdf). See the [StormingRobots](https://github.com/asubramanian08/StormingRobots) repository for more general information. During the class I learn how to code in c++ with things like [template classes](https://github.com/asubramanian08/C-plus-plus/tree/master/Ch14-TemplateClasses) and [the STL](https://github.com/asubramanian08/C-plus-plus/tree/master/Ch16-STL). We also do interesting projects were I built my own [CSV file sorter](https://github.com/asubramanian08/C-plus-plus/tree/master/PB1-CSVProject) and [SplayMap](https://github.com/asubramanian08/C-plus-plus/tree/master/PB2-SplayTrees).
